**Test Driven Development**

In this task, I was asked to use Test Driven Development to create a simple app, being able to convert inches to centimeters, milimeters or meters when run. I first had to create the tests and figure out how they could be run correctly to test out the new functionalities. After this was done, I started creating simple conversions for centimeters to test this, then I moved on to milimeters and lastly meters. While doing this I also added some if statements that were able to identify if the input was correct and if it contained -t at the end, a test would be run only. I had some trouble creating the tests in the beginning as I got some errors when I tried to test for milimeters, which I had to figure out and edit the conversion method so that the tests could be running without getting build errors. After this was done, I had a ConvertUnit method that worked well and was able to perform tests for all conversion units. The buttons turned into question marks so I had to add a line that made sure the unicode was enabled so the colored buttons would also shown, and after that I had no more problems with this. Overall there were some frustrating things underways, but luckily I managed to identify this quickly and fix it so that I could iron out the testing and finish the application.
